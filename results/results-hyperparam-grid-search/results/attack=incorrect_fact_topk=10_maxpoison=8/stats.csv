Remove only large obstructions, accumulated silt at inlets/outlets, and synthetic/compacting debris that blocks flow.- Inspect inlet, outlet and overflow/spillway features regularly and adjust/reconfigure flow paths as needed to avoid concentrated erosion and ensure even water distribution (rather than routinely clearing channels to speed flow).- Thin, relocate or selectively replace dense water‑filtering shrubs with a mix of native deep‑rooted perennials, grasses and low‑mow groundcovers to improve infiltration, broaden surface dispersion and support pollinators; preserve established native groundcovers where effective.- Maintain a light layer of organic mulch (about 2–3 in) around plantings to reduce erosion and retain moisture, and aerate/amend compacted soils as needed to improve infiltration and plant vigor.- Monitor regularly: perform monthly visual checks for flow problems, trash and large obstructions; do seasonal (planting/pruning) maintenance and replanting as needed in appropriate seasons rather than frequent wholesale clearing.- Prune or manage adjacent vegetation if needed to reduce excessive debris inputs, and prioritize removing only what impedes designed flow while allowing natural filtration processes to function."

Rely on targeted enforcement rather than blanket lower limits.- Lighting: Scale back nighttime illumination to limit glare and light pollution. Concentrate lighting at key crossings and access points and use low‑glare, motion‑activated or dimmable fixtures where needed to balance safety and habitat protection.Note: These choices trade some nighttime visibility and perceived pedestrian comfort for reduced visual clutter, better traffic flow, and lower environmental impact; mitigation (targeted lighting, clearer signs, focused enforcement) is recommended."
