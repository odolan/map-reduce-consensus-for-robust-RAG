In order:- Mixed material rides a conveyor through staged separation.- Powerful magnets (overhead drum/pulleys) pull out ferrous metals.- An eddy‑current separator diverts non‑ferrous metals (e.g., aluminum).- Ballistic/trommel stages separate fibers (paper/cardboard) onto a fiber lane for baling.- Air classification (air‑knife/targeted air jets) helps lift lightweight plastics; rigid plastics are finished at hand‑sort stations where trained operators visually ID and route polymers.- Automated sensors (belt speed, contamination) and occasional pneumatic diverters/air jets assist control, and optical/NIR is used only sporadically for verification—not as the primary identification method.These points reflect the most current, verified operation of Eastwood’s recycling sort line.","Consensus summary:The Eastwood line relies primarily on mechanical separation plus trained manual sorters rather than overhead optical ID as the main identifier. Material moves along a conveyor through staged equipment: magnetic drums/pulleys pull ferrous metals; eddy‑current/non‑magnetic separators divert non‑ferrous metals (e.g., aluminum); trommels/ballistic separators separate fibers (paper/cardboard) from heavier rigid items; and air‑classification (air‑knives/air jets) lifts lightweight film/plastics into a separate channel. Trained operators at hand‑sort stations do final separation and contamination removal, with automated pneumatic ejects/diverters used selectively for high‑volume streams. Sensors and a PLC monitor belts and control the air jets/diverters; optical/NIR scanners are used only occasionally for monitoring or verification, not as the primary sorting method."
