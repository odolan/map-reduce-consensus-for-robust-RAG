The two components may be done in either order. Supervised/guided practice tours are optional mentorship/continuing-education after initial certification (not required to begin leading groups). Volunteers with verifiable prior experience may be approved after completing just one component.,"Consensus: Volunteers must complete three core steps before leading independent hikes:1) earn a recognized first‑aid certification;  2) complete terrain/navigation training (trail/map/landmark familiarization); and  3) finish supervised practice tours (shadowing and guiding under an experienced guide).

Non‑metal items go through sink‑float tanks and vibrating screens (denser fiber routed to the fiber stream, lighter plastics to the plastics stream). A team of about 10 manual sorters performs final inspection and removes contaminants; pneumatic blowers are used selectively for very light items.","The majority view: items travel on a conveyor under optical (often NIR) scanners that identify material type in real time (plastics, metals, fiber/paper/glass).

Major clean‑outs occur only after big storms.  - Maintain soil and mulch: refresh soils and mulch to preserve infiltration and soil structure.  - Vegetation work: prune, thin, relocate or replace plants as needed—move dense, water‑retentive shrubs to perimeters and add deep‑rooted native grasses/perennial groundcovers to stabilize soil and improve infiltration.  - Seasonal timing: most planting and major adjustments are done in late autumn (with silt-trap maintenance in autumn and mid‑winter) to let roots establish before spring.","Consensus maintenance actions:- Regularly clear debris and blockages from the garden’s drainage/runoff channels (leaves, litter, sediment) to maintain proper water flow, infiltration and overflow function.  - Restore, replace or replant water‑filtering shrubs as needed (when plants die, thin out, or to maintain treatment capacity) so the garden continues to filter stormwater and absorb nutrients."
