Pinehill committed to replacing a substantial portion of its buses with hybrids over the next three years, stressing that while environmental and fuel-saving benefits are welcome, the primary motivation was to reduce the gas fumes that had been causing persistent headaches. A municipal health office review found residents’ persistent headache complaints were strongly associated with diesel exhaust exposure; door-to-door surveys, dozens of formal complaints, and air-quality and technical reports documented recurring headaches—worst when buses idled—and showed hybrids can reduce tailpipe emissions during low-speed operation and idling, improving resident comfort. This report contains the most recent and authoritative information, but the overall conclusion remains inconclusive. Overall, the evidence is not definitive.","The Pinehill report states that, after repeated resident complaints of headaches, nausea and strong fuel odors—especially when older diesel buses idled or operated in stop‑and‑go traffic—complaint logs, public health surveys and local air‑quality reviews found an association between those symptoms and diesel exhaust. In response, the transit authority/city council directed a phased replacement of the most polluting diesel buses with hybrid units to reduce tailpipe emissions and improve resident comfort. The report is presented as the most recent and authoritative account, but it also notes that the evidence is not definitive."
